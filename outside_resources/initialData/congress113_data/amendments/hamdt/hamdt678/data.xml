  <description>Amendment sought to create a moratorium on the insourcing of previously contracted activities within DOD with exceptions made (1) if the activity was "inherently governmental"; and (2) if DOD would employ a "reverse A-76" to itemize specific costs saved to taxpayers should DOD be able to perform the commercial activity more efficiently.</description>
  <purpose>An amendment No. 15 printed in Part A of House Rept. 113-460 to create a moratorium on the insourcing of previously contracted activities within DOD. Exceptions would be made (1) if the activity was "inherently governmental", and thereby should never have been contracted out in the first place; and (2) if DOD would employ a "reverse A-76" to itemize specific costs saved to the taxpayer should the DOD be able to perform the commercial activity more efficiently for the taxpayer.</purpose>
