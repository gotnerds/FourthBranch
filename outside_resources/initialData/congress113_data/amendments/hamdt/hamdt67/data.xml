  <description>Amendment sought to add a finding that the reliance on oil sands crudes for transportation fuels would likely result in an increase in incremental greenhouse gas emissions in the United States equivalent to approximately that of 4.3 million passenger vehicles. The amendment also sought to provide that the bill would not go into effect unless the President found that TransCanada or tar sands producers could fully offset the additional greenhouse gas emissions produced annually.</description>
