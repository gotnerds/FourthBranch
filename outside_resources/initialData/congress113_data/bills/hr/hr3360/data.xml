  <summary>10/28/2013--Introduced.
Revises provisions concerning pre-trial investigations of charges and specifications under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) to limit such investigation to a determination of whether there is probable cause to believe that the accused committed the specified offense, consideration of the form of charges, and the recommended disposition. Prohibits the purpose of the investigation to be to serve as a discovery tool for the accused. Requires an experienced judge advocate to conduct the investigation, or, in the alternative, to serve as legal advisor to an investigating officer who is not a judge advocate.

Requires the accused, prior to the investigation, to be provided: (1) any sworn or signed statement relating to the offense that is in the government's possession; (2) an opportunity to inspect any books, papers, documents, photographs, objects, buildings, places, or scientific tests or experiments that are in the possession, custody, or control of military authorities and are intended to be used as evidence against the accused; and (3) any evidence known to the government counsel that reasonably tends to negate or reduce the guilt of the accused.

Requires a complaining witness involved in such investigation to be given the opportunity, but not be required, to testify.

Eliminates the accused's right to a reinvestigation of charges upon demand.</summary>
