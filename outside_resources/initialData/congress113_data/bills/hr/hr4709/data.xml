  <summary>5/21/2014--Introduced.
Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act of 2014 - Amends the Controlled Substances Act to provide that: (1) a determination by the Attorney General that a registration to manufacture, distribute, or dispense a controlled substance is "consistent with the public health and safety" means that it has a substantial relationship to such Act's purpose of preventing diversion and abuse of controlled substances; and (2) a finding of "imminent danger" by the Attorney General justifying immediate suspension of such a registration means that there is a significant and present risk of death or serious bodily harm that is more likely than not to occur in the absence of such a suspension.

Requires the Attorney General, before revoking or suspending a registration under such Act, to: (1) provide the registrant notice of the grounds for doing so, and where such grounds consist of a legal violation, a specific citation to such law; (2) give the registrant an opportunity to submit a corrective action plan within a reasonable time period; and (3) determine whether, in light of the plan, revocation or suspension proceedings should be discontinued or deferred or additional changes need to be made in such plan.

Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), acting through the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (FDA) and the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to submit a report: (1) assessing how patient access to medications could be adversely impacted by federal and state law enforcement activities, and (2) identifying how collaboration between agencies and stakeholders can benefit patients and prevent diversion and abuse of controlled substances.
