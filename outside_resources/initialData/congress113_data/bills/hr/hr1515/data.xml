  <summary>4/11/2013--Introduced.
21st Century Global Health Technology Act - Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to establish in the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) a program to develop technologies designed to: (1) improve the health and nutrition of populations in developing countries; (2) reduce maternal, newborn, and child mortality in such countries; and (3) improve the diagnosis, prevention, and reduction of disease, especially HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, and other infectious diseases in such countries.

States that such program shall: (1) be carried out under a cooperative agreement between USAID and one or more institutions with a successful record of advancing the technologies described in this Act and integrating practical field experience into the research and development process, and (2) codify the Health Technologies program under which USAID supports the development of technologies for global health.

States that USAID's Center for Accelerating Innovation and Impact shall continue its work to speed the development, introduction, and scale-up of priority global health interventions.

Directs USAID to report annually to Congress on USAID research and development activities.</summary>
