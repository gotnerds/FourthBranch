  <summary>7/31/2013--Passed House amended.
Nuclear Iran Prevention Act of 2013 - (Sec. 2) States that it shall be U.S. policy to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability.

Title I: Human Rights and Terrorism Sanctions - (Sec. 101) Amends the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 to subject to mandatory sanctions a foreign financial institution that facilitates a significant transaction or provides significant financial services for a person that: (1) is subject to human rights-related sanctions, or (2) exports sensitive technology to Iran and is subject to the prohibition on procurement contracts.

(Sec. 102) Expands specified requirements regarding the identification of countries that allow the diversion of certain goods, services, and technologies to Iran.

Authorizes the President to impose restrictions on U.S. foreign assistance under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act with respect to a country designated as a country of diversion concern if such restrictions would prevent the transfer of U.S.-origin goods, services, and technology to Iran.

Prohibits the imposition of sanctions on the importation of goods.

(Sec. 103) Directs the Secretary of State (Secretary) to determine if Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) meets the criteria for designation as a foreign terrorist organization and: (1) if so, designate the IRGC as a foreign terrorist organization; and (2) if not, report to Congress concerning those criteria which have not been met.

(Sec. 104) Amends the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 to expand the list of Iranian government officials who are responsible for human rights violations, censorship, and the diversion of food, medicine, and other goods destined for the people of Iran.

Expresses the sense of Congress that the President should impose sanctions on such persons, and identify and impose sanctions on other senior Iranian officials who are complicit in human rights violations.

(Sec. 105) Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the Iranian people are deprived by their government of free and credible elections; (2) the United States should support freedom, human rights, civil liberties, free elections, and the rule of law in Iran; and (3) the United States should support the people of Iran in their peaceful calls for a democratic government.

(Sec. 106) Expresses the sense of Congress that the Secretary should designate a Special Coordinator in the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs to facilitate the advancement of human rights and political participation for women in Iran, as well as to identify Iranian officials who were involved in violating the human rights of women.

Title II: Economic and Financial Sanctions - Subtitle A: Amendments to Iran Sanctions Act of 1996 - (Sec. 201) Amends the Iran Sanctions Act of 1996 to direct the President to impose specified sanctions on a person who knowingly transferred to Iran goods, services, or technology that would materially contribute to Iran's ability to mine or mill uranium.

(Sec. 202) Eliminates presidential waiver authority with respect to the application of sanctions against persons who aid Iran's weapons of mass destruction (WMD) or other military programs.

Subtitle B: Amendments to Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability and Divestment Act of 2010 and Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 - (Sec. 211) Amends the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability and Divestment Act of 2010 to: (1) increase the range of sanctions and require that sanctions be applied against a person that exports sensitive technology to Iran, and (2) apply the sanctions to persons owned or controlled by a person that provides such technology.

(Sec. 212) Expresses the sense of Congress that the United States should respect state or local decisions to divest from or prohibit the investment of assets, prohibit the issuance of business licenses, and impose transparency requirements on a person that is subject to sanctions.

Authorizes a state or local government with respect to a person subject to specified sanctions to: (1) divest assets from such person, (2) prohibit investment of assets in such person, or (3) impose transparency requirements on such person.

(Sec. 213) Expresses the sense of Congress that the President should continue to cooperate with the European Union (EU) and its member states to restrict access to and use of the euro currency by Iran and its agencies and instrumentalities, with exceptions for food, medicine, medical devices, and agricultural commodities.

(Sec. 214) Amends the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 to: (1) direct the President to prohibit the opening, and prohibit or impose strict conditions on the maintaining, in the United States of a correspondent account or a payable-through account by a foreign financial institution that is a person described in this Act; and (2) authorize the President to impose sanctions pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act with respect to any other person described in this Act.

Describes such person as a person that knowingly: (1) conducted or facilitated a significant transaction involving the currency of a country other than the country in which the person is operating with, for, or on behalf of the Central Bank of Iran or another Iranian financial institution designated by the Secretary of the Treasury for the imposition of sanctions, or a person that is involved in the strategic sectors of Iran; or (2) conducted or facilitated a significant transaction by another person involving the currency of a country other than the country in which that other person is operating at the time of the transaction, with, for, or on behalf of a person described in clause (1).

Authorizes the President to waive the provisions of this Act for reasons of U.S. national security. Requires congressional notification at least seven days prior to a waiver or waiver renewal.

Excludes from such sanctions transactions for the sale of agricultural commodities, food, medicine or medical devices to Iran.

(Sec. 215) Authorizes the President to impose sanctions on a foreign person that knowingly conducted or facilitated a significant financial transaction with the Central Bank of Iran or other Iranian financial institution that has been designated for sanctions pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, for the purchase of goods or services: (1) by a person in Iran or on behalf of a person in Iran, or (2) from a person in Iran or on behalf of a person in Iran.

Prohibits sanctions to be imposed on the importation of goods.

States that nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the imposition of sanctions on a financial transaction for the purchase of petroleum or petroleum products from Iran under the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012.

Authorizes the President to not impose sanctions on a foreign person if the country with primary jurisdiction over such person has, during a specified 60-day period, significantly reduced the value and volume of imports and exports of goods (other than petroleum or petroleum products) and services between such country and Iran.

Prohibits the imposition of sanctions on transactions for agricultural commodities, food, medicine, or medical devices.

Subtitle C: Other Matters - (Sec. 221) Amends the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 to require that a country purchasing Iranian oil reduce such purchases by one million barrels per day within one year in order to obtain a "significant reduction" exemption from sanctions. (Thus permitting it to continue to purchase Iranian oil.)

Exempts a country from such ineligibility if it has: (1) dramatically reduced its crude oil purchases from Iran or of Iranian origin during such one-year period, and (2) and committed itself to continue to reduce such crude oil purchases to a de minimis level.

Defines "crude oil" to include unfinished oils, liquefied petroleum gases, distillate fuel oil, and residual fuel oil.

Amends the definition of "significant reductions" to include both price and volume.

(Sec. 222) Amends the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 to include the automotive, mining, construction, and engineering sectors as sectors in Iran that are facilitating Iran's nuclear proliferation activities.

Designates, in lieu of current entities, entities that operate special economic zones, free economic zones, and entities in strategic sectors as entities of proliferation concern.

Directs the President to block the property of entities that operate special economic zones or free economic zones, and entities in strategic sectors.

Defines "strategic sector" as: (1) the energy, shipping, shipbuilding, automotive, or mining sector of Iran; and (2) the construction or engineering sector of Iran if the President determines and reports to Congress that the construction or engineering sector of Iran is of strategic importance.
