  <summary>3/19/2013--Introduced.
Home Construction Lending Regulatory Improvement Act of 2013 - Directs the appropriate federal banking agencies to initiate a coordinated rulemaking with respect to financial institutions under their respective jurisdictions that make real estate loans to home builders.

Requires such rulemaking to provide for: (1) elimination of the 100% of bank capital measurement, (2) realistic market-based appraisals, and (3) a prohibition against compelling lenders to call or curtail loans in good standing.

Prohibits a federal banking agency from preventing a qualified financial institution from making a real estate loan to a home builder that has a viable project.</summary>
