Requires each state to receive at least $20 million of formula funds, all of which shall be used with respect to low and moderate-income individuals and families.

Requires each state and local government grantee to establish procedures to create preferences for development of affordable rental housing.

Allows a grantee to use up to 10% to create jobs by establishing and operating a program to maintain eligible neighborhood properties.

Sets forth Buy American requirements.
