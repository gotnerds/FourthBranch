Spending Reduction Act - Requires the head of each executive agency to submit to the President and Congress a report on the implementation of recommendations made by specified Government Accountability Office (GAO) reports on reducing duplication in government programs, achieving savings, and enhancing revenue.

Requires: (1) such agency reports to include recommendations by the agency heads for actions that should be taken as a result of such GAO reports; and (2) agency heads to begin implementation of such recommendations in order to eliminate, consolidate, streamline, or better coordinate government programs and agencies with duplicative, overlapping, or fragmented missions identified in the GAO reports, unless Congress enacts a joint resolution disapproving them.</summary>
