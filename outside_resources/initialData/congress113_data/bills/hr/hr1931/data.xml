  <summary>5/9/2013--Introduced.
Employees of America Streamlining for Your Savings Act of 2013 or the EASY Savings Act of 2013 - Expands the awards program for disclosures by federal employees of fraud, waste, or mismanagement that result in cost savings to the employee's agency to include identification of surplus funds or unnecessary budget authority. Directs that any savings resulting from the identification of such funds or budget authority be deposited in the Treasury and used to reduce a budget deficit or the federal debt.

Prohibits the payment of awards to: (1) the head of an agency; (2) federal officers who serve in a position at level I of the Executive Schedule, and (3) a voting member of an independent establishment.</summary>
