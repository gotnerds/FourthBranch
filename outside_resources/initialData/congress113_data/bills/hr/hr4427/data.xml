  <summary>4/8/2014--Introduced.
Expanding Nutrition's Role in Curricula and Healthcare Act or the ENRICH Act - Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish a program of three-year competitive grants to accredited medical schools for the development or expansion of an integrated nutrition curriculum.

Describes such a curriculum as one that: (1) is based on best possible evidence to improve communication and provider preparedness in the prevention, management, and, as possible, reversal of obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer; and (2) addresses such topics as nutrition across the life cycle of members of at-risk populations and food insecurity and malnutrition among such individuals.</summary>
