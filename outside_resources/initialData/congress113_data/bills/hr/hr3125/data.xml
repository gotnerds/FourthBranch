  <summary>9/18/2013--Introduced.
Authorizes the Secretary of the Air Force to make a competitive grant to an existing biofuels research center in the United States to conduct pilot-scale research, development, and testing of bio-based fuels for use by the Air Force as aviation fuel for jet aircraft. Permits a recipient to use grant funds to train military and civilian personnel in the new technologies and to conduct a study regarding the economic feasibility of a full-scale bio-based aviation fuel production facility.

Directs the Secretary to give preference to a center that: (1) has the capacity and expertise necessary to quickly and efficiently conduct such research, development, and testing; and (2) is located in close proximity to specified raw materials, a military installation with responsibility for military air transportation, and a private or commercial airport with capacity to host a research and pilot production facility.

Directs the Secretary of Defense (DOD) to transfer to the Secretary of the Air Force a specified amount from the Afghanistan Infrastructure Fund to fund such grants.</summary>
