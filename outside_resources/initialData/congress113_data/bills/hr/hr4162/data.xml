  <summary>3/6/2014--Introduced.
Job Creation through Energy Efficient Manufacturing Act - Requires the Secretary of Energy (DOE) to establish a Financing Energy Efficient Manufacturing Program to provide grants to states to establish or expand programs to finance energy efficiency retrofit, onsite clean and renewable energy, smart grid, and alternative vehicle fleet projects for industrial businesses (covered programs).

Defines "state" as a state, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and any other territory or possession of the United States.

Requires the Secretary to consult with states and stakeholders to establish a process to identify financing opportunities for manufacturing and industrial business with asset portfolios across multiple states.

Requires states that receive such funding to give a higher priority to covered programs that: (1) leverage private and nonfederal sources of funding, and (2) aim to expand the use of energy efficiency project financing using private sources of funding.

Requires: (1) states receiving such grants to collect, share, and report on data resulting from covered programs carried out under this Act; and (2) the Secretary to incorporate the data into appropriate DOE databases, with provisions for the protection of confidential business data.

Requires grant funds to be provided to the state office responsible for developing the state energy plan under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act.</summary>
