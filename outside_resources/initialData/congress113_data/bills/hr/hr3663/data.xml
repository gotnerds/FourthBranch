  <summary>12/5/2013--Introduced.
Reducing Federal Mandates on School Lunch Act - Prohibits the Secretary of Agriculture from implementing, administering, or enforcing a specified regulation, or promulgating or enforcing any new rule or regulation, establishing a maximum calorie limit or quantity of grains, meat, or meat alternatives for the school lunch program.

Prohibits the Secretary from implementing, administering, or enforcing specified rules and regulations with respect to any school food authority that certifies to its state that it: (1) has calculated the costs of complying with such rules and regulations; and (2) has determined, in a manner consistent with school district operational procedures, that it cannot operate a food service program without incurring increased costs for complying with those rules and regulations.

Identifies those rules and regulations as:

 the rule entitled "National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program: Nutrition Standards for All Foods Sold in School as Required by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010"; any new rule regarding foods sold in schools that are not foods provided under the school lunch or breakfast programs; a specified regulation and any new rule or regulation regarding school lunch price increases; and a specified regulation and any new rule or regulation which establishes new food-based meal patterns, nutrition standards, or meal planning approaches for the school breakfast program. Prohibits the Secretary from defining the phrase "costs of complying" or establishing or suggesting how a school food authority is to calculate those costs or increased costs for complying.

Maintains these prohibitions until a law is enacted that extends by at least five fiscal years the authorization or duration of one or more school lunch or breakfast programs.</summary>
