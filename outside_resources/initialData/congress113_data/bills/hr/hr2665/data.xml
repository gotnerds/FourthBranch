  <summary>7/11/2013--Introduced.
Amends the federal criminal code to repeal provisions: (1) establishing exceptions to the prohibition against a licensed importer, manufacturer, or dealer transferring a firearm to any person other than a licensed importer, manufacturer, or dealer unless the transferee is provided with a secure gun storage or safety device; and (2) granting immunity from a qualified civil liability action to a person who has lawful possession and control of a handgun and who uses such a device.

Revises penalty provisions by authorizing the Attorney General to suspend (currently for not more than six months) or revoke any firearms license of, or to subject to a civil penalty of up to $10,000 (currently $2,500), any licensee who has knowingly violated such prohibition.</summary>
