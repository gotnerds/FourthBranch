  <summary>2/5/2014--Introduced.
Save our Military Shopping Benefits Act - Prohibits, until January 1, 2017, the Secretary of Defense (DOD) from: (1) closing any commissary or exchange store located within the United States, or (2) developing or implementing any plan that would result in the closure of all commissaries in the United States as part of a cost-saving effort.

Defines "close" to include any action that has the effect of: (1) reducing the operating hours or size of a commissary or exchange store below FY2014 levels, or (2) changing the location of such a store. Excepts a change in the size or location of such a store if the Secretary determines that the change is required for upgrading or modifying an existing structure for safety or health reasons.</summary>
