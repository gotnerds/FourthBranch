  <summary>2/21/2014--Introduced.
Flood Insurance Flexibility Act of 2014 - Amends the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 to direct the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to make available, at the option of the insured, flood insurance coverage for properties with premiums and deductibles which have an annual loss-deductible for damage to the covered property of at least $10,000.

Authorizes FEMA to make coverage available with higher loss-deductible amounts that it considers feasible and appropriate.

Requires such flood insurance coverage to have a chargeable risk premium rate that, as determined by FEMA, accurately reflects both the current risk of flood to the property and the deductible.</summary>
