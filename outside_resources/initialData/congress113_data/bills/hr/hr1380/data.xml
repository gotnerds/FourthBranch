Access to Congressionally Mandated Reports Act - Requires the Public Printer to establish and maintain a website accessible by the public for obtaining electronic copies of all congressionally mandated reports in one place.

Requires each federal agency to provide the Public Printer with electronic copies of its congressionally mandated reports for publication on the website. Prohibits an agency head from changing or removing a report published on the website, except for technical changes, without the express, written consent of the chairman of each congressional committee to which the report is submitted.

Exempts information or records that are exempt from public disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) from publication on the website. Requires each agency head to redact from congressionally mandated reports any information that may not be publicly released under FOIA before submission for publication on the website.</summary>
