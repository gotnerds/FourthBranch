  <summary>6/5/2014--Introduced.
Family Coverage Act - Expresses the sense of Congress that the Secretaries of Health and Human Services (HHS)&#160;and the Treasury have the administrative authority, within their respective jurisdictions, to apply the affordability provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act so as to expand access to affordable health insurance coverage for working families without further legislation.

Amends the Internal Revenue Code to modify the affordability requirement for the tax credit for health care premium assistance to provide that an employee is eligible for premium assistance if his or her required contribution to an employer-sponsored health care plan does not exceed 9.5% of&#160;family household income.</summary>
