  <summary>7/22/2014--Introduced.
Directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to submit to Congress a report containing an analysis of: (1) the extent to which consumers in each local market have access to broadcast programming from television broadcast stations located outside their local market; (2) whether there are alternatives to the use of designated market areas to define markets that would provide consumers with more local programming options; and (3) the potential impact that such alternatives could have on localism and on broadcast television locally, regionally, and nationally.

Requires such report to include recommendations on how to foster increased localism in states served by out-of-state designated market areas.</summary>
