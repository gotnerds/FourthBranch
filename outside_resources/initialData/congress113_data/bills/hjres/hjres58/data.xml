  <summary>9/9/2013--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the American people and Congress do not support the use of the U.S. Armed Forces in, or directed at, Syria; and (2) there are not overriding imminent U.S. national security interests at stake and Congress will not fund any military action taken in contradiction to this joint resolution.

Prohibits the use of funds available to any U.S. government department or agency for the use of force in, or directed at, Syria by the U.S. Armed Forces unless a subsequent Act of Congress specifically authorizes such use of force or there is an attack or imminent attack on the United States, its territories or possessions, or the U.S. Armed Forces.</summary>
