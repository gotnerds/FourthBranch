  <summary>5/6/2014--Passed Senate without amendment.
Supports the people of Nigeria, especially the parents and families of the girls abducted by Boko Haram in Borno state.

Condemns Boko Haram for its attacks on civilian targets, including schools, mosques, churches, villages, and agricultural centers.

 Encourages: (1) the government of Nigeria to strengthen efforts to protect children seeking an education and to hold those who conduct such attacks accountable, and (2) U.S. efforts to assist in such Nigerian actions.

Urges timely civilian assistance from the United States and allied African nations to rescue and reintegrate the abducted girls.

Recognizes that the empowerment of women is linked to the potential of countries to generate economic growth, sustainable democracy, and inclusive security.

Encourages the Department of State and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USDA) to continue supporting initiatives that positively impact the ability of women and girls to fully access their human rights.</summary>
