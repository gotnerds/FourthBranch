  <summary>4/12/2013--Introduced.
Disapproves of the decision of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to modify the Prohibited Items List, set to take effect on April 25, 2013, that would allow passengers to bring small knives in their carry-on baggage. Calls for TSA to delay implementation of those changes until it conducts a formal engagement process involving all affected stakeholders and has meaningful consultations with affected air travel industry stakeholders, including flight attendants.</summary>
