  <summary>7/7/2014--Introduced.
Declares that the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) has failed to meet the specified requirement of the U.S. Constitution to take care that a law be faithfully executed, with respect to the departmental policy to exercise prosecutorial discretion with respect to individuals who came to the United States as children, as announced by DHS on June 15, 2012.

Requires the House of Representatives to bring a civil action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia for declaratory or injunctive relief to challenge the DHS policy.</summary>
