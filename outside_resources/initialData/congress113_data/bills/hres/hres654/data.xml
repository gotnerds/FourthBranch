  <summary>7/7/2014--Introduced.
Declares that the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) has failed to meet the specified requirement of the U.S. Constitution to take care that a law be faithfully executed, with respect to the departmental policy providing for the authorization, approval, renewal, modification, or extension of any experimental, pilot, or demonstration project under the Social Security Act (SSA) that waives compliance with a mandatory work requirement by eligible states and state plans for participation in block grants under SSA title IV part A (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) (TANF).

Requires the House of Representatives to bring a civil action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia for declaratory or injunctive relief to challenge the Secretary.</summary>
