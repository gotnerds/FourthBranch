  <summary>10/22/2013--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) those individuals responsible for the July 1999 murders of U.S. citizens Ylli, Agron, and Mehmet Bytyqi in Serbia should be brought to justice; (2) it is reprehensible that no individual has ever been found guilty for executing the Bytyqi brothers, or of any other crimes associated with their deaths; (3) the government of Serbia and its relevant ministries and offices, including the Serbian War Crimes Prosecutor's Office, should make it a priority to investigate and prosecute those current or former officials believed to be responsible for their deaths; (4) the United States should devote sufficient resources to assist and monitor Serbia's efforts to investigate and prosecute those individuals believed to be responsible; and (5) progress in resolving this case should remain a significant factor in determining the further development of U.S.- Serbia relations.</summary>
