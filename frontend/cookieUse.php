	<h1>The Fourth Branch’s use of cookies and similar technologies</h1>
	<p>The Fourth Branch uses cookies and other similar technologies, such as pixels or local storage, to help provide you with a better, faster, and safer experience. Here are some of the ways that The Fourth Branch services—including our various websites, SMS, APIs, email notifications, applications, buttons, widgets, and ads—use these technologies: to log you into The Fourth Branch, save your preferences, personalize the content you see, protect against spam and abuse, and show you more relevant ads.</p>
	<p>Below we explain how The Fourth Branch, our partners, and other third parties use these technologies, your privacy settings and the other options you have.</p>
	<h4>What are cookies, pixels, and local storage?</h4>
	<p>Cookies are small files that websites place on your computer as you browse the web. Like many websites, The Fourth Branch uses cookies to discover how people are using our services and to make them work better.</p>
	<p>A pixel is a small amount of code on a web page or in an email notification. As many services do, we use pixels to learn whether you’ve interacted with certain web or email content. This helps us measure and improve our services and personalize your experience on The Fourth Branch.</p>
	<p>Local storage is an industry-standard technology that allows a website or application to store information locally on your computer or mobile device. We use local storage to customize what we show you based on your past interactions with The Fourth Branch.</p>
	<h4>Why does The Fourth Branch use these technologies?</h4>
	<p>The Fourth Branch uses these technologies to deliver, measure, and improve our services in various ways. These uses generally fall into one of the following categories:</p>
	<h5>Authentication and security:</h5>
	<ol>
		<li>To log you into The Fourth Branch</li>
		<li>To protect your security</li>
		<li>To help us detect and fight spam, abuse, and other activities that violate The Fourth Branch Terms</li>
	</ol>
	<p>For example, these technologies help authenticate your access to The Fourth Branch and prevent unauthorized parties from accessing your account. They also let us show you appropriate content through our services.</p>
	<h5>Preferences:</h5> 
	<p class="indent">To remember information about your browser and your preferences</p>
	<p>For example, cookies help us remember your preferred language. We can then provide you with The Fourth Branch content in your preferred language without having to ask you each time you visit The Fourth Branch. </p>
	<h5>Analytics and research: </h5>
	<p class="indent">To help us improve and understand how people use our services, including The Fourth Branch buttons and widgets, and The Fourth Branch Ads</p>
	<p>For example, cookies help us test different versions of our services to see which particular features or content users prefer. We might also optimize and improve your experience on The Fourth Branch by using cookies to see how you interact with our services, such as when and how often you use them and what links you click on. We may use Google Analytics to assist us with this.</p>
	<h5>Personalized content: </h5>
	<p class="indent">To customize our services with more relevant content, ads, and suggestions for people to follow</p>
	<p>For example, local storage tells us which parts of your The Fourth Branch timeline you have viewed already so that we can show you the appropriate new content. Cookies can help us make smarter and more relevant suggestions about who you might enjoy following based on your recent visits to websites that have integrated The Fourth Branch buttons or widgets. We can suggest people who are frequently followed by other The Fourth Branch users that visit the same websites. </p>
	<h5>Advertising: </h5>
	<p class="indent">To help us deliver ads, measure their performance, and make them more relevant to you based on criteria like your activity on The Fourth Branch and visits to our ad partners' websites</p>
	<p>For example, we use cookies and pixels to tailor ads and measure their performance. Using these technologies, we can show you ads and evaluate their effectiveness based on your visits to our ad partners' websites. This helps advertisers provide high-quality ads and content that might be more interesting to you. </p>
	<h4>Where are these technologies used?</h4>
	<p>The Fourth Branch uses these technologies on our own websites and services and on other websites that have integrated our services. This includes our advertising and platform partners’ websites and sites that use The Fourth Branch buttons or widgets. Third parties may also use these technologies when you interact with their content from within our services, like when you click a link or stream video on The Fourth Branch from a third-party website.</p>
	<h4>What are my privacy options?</h4>
	<p>There are several options available to you that offer meaningful privacy choices.  You have a number of options to control or limit how The Fourth Branch, our partners, and other third parties use cookies:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>For tailoring ads on The Fourth Branch: If you do not want The Fourth Branch to tailor ads based on our ad partners’ information, including cookies, you can use your Do Not Track browser setting.</li>
		<li>For using cookies: You can modify your settings in most web browsers to accept or deny all cookies, or to request your permission each time a site attempts to set a cookie. Although cookies are not required for some parts of our services, The Fourth Branch may not work properly if you disable cookies entirely. For example, you cannot log into TheFourthBranch.co if you've disabled all cookie use.</li>
