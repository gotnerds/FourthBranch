  <description>Manager's amendment strikes the subsection requiring a 90 day decision deadline and replaces it with a 30 day decision deadline requiring DOE to issue a final decision on applications to export LNG following the conclusion of the NEPA environmental review of the LNG facilities. For the purposes of the 30 day decision deadline, the NEPA review would be considered concluded: for a project requiring an Environmental Impact Statement, 30 days after publication of a Final Environmental Impact Statement; for a project for which an Environmental Assessment has been prepared, 30 days after publication by DOE of a Finding of No Significant Impact; and upon determination by the lead agency that an application is eligible for a Categorical Exclusion pursuant to NEPA.</description>
