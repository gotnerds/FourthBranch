  <summary>1/29/2014--Introduced.
Recognizes the rejection of the Lecompton Constitution of the Territory of Kansas by the House of Representatives in 1858 as a critical action in admitting Kansas as a free state into the Union of the United States.

Acknowledges the drafting and ensuing debate of that Constitution as a significant catalyst that would lead to the Civil War and the ultimate abolition of slavery.

Congratulates the city of Lecompton, Kansas, for maintaining its historical heritage.</summary>
