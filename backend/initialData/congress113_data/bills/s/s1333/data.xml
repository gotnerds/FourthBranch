  <summary>7/18/2013--Introduced.
Increased Competition for Consumers Act - Transfers to the Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan (CO-OP) program the unobligated balance of funds transferred under the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 to a fund to provide assistance and oversight to qualified nonprofit health insurance issuers awarded loans or grants pursuant to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA).

Amends PPACA to appropriate the amount equal to the amount rescinded (unobligated funds for the CO-OP program as of January 2, 2013) under the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 to carry out such program. Removes the time restriction on the award of CO-OP program loans and grants.</summary>
