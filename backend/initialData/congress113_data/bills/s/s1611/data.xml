  <summary>5/6/2014--Reported to Senate amended.
Federal Data Center Consolidation Act of 2013 - Requires the heads of specified federal agencies, assisted by their chief information officers, to submit to the Administrator for the Office of E-Government and Information Technology of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) each fiscal year: (1) a comprehensive inventory of data centers owned, operated, or maintained by such agency; and (2) a multi-year strategy to achieve the consolidation and optimization of such data centers that includes performance metrics, a timeline for agency activities to be completed under the OMB Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative (FDCCI), and year-by-year calculations of investments and cost savings.

Requires the Administrator to: (1)&#160;establish deadlines for annual reporting and requirements such agencies must meet to be considered in compliance with this Act; (2)&#160;develop and make publicly available a goal for the amount of planned cost savings and optimization improvements achieved through the FDCCI during a specified period; (3) aggregate the reported cost savings of each agency and optimization improvements achieved to date through the FDCCI and compare such savings to the projected cost savings and optimization improvements achieved through the FDCCI; and (4) report to Congress. Directs the Comptroller General (GAO) to review and verify the quality and completeness of the asset inventory and strategy of each agency and report to Congress.

Requires such agencies to implement&#160;their data center consolidation and optimization strategies consistent with federal guidelines on cloud computing security, including: (1) applicable provisions in the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), and (2) guidance published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).&#160;

Authorizes the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to waive the applicability of any provision of this Act to any element of the intelligence community if such waiver is in the interest of national security.

Repeals this Act effective on October 1, 2018.</summary>
