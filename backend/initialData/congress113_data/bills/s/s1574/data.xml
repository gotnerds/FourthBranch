  <summary>10/16/2013--Introduced.
Indian Employment, Training and Related Services Consolidation Act of 2013 - Amends the Indian Employment, Training and Related Services Demonstration Act of 1992 to give the Secretary of the Interior the exclusive authority to approve or disapprove a plan submitted by an Indian tribe or tribal organization to integrate federal employment, training, and related services into a consolidated and comprehensive program.

 Deems a plan to be approved if the Secretary does not approve or disapprove the plan within 90 days of receiving it.

Gives tribes and tribal organizations certain hearing and appeal rights if their plan is denied.

Prohibits a tribe or tribal organization from being required to submit any additional budget, report, audit, supplemental audit, or other documentation after its plan is approved.

Gives an affected federal agency 90 days to decide on a request by a tribe or tribal organization for a waiver of statutory, regulatory, or administrative requirements that prevent them from efficiently implementing their plan.

Directs the Secretary to establish and initiate an interagency dispute resolution process if an affected federal agency denies such a request and the Secretary determines that the waiver would not be inconsistent with such Act's provisions or prevent the affected agency from fulfilling its obligations under such Act. Gives the affected agency the final authority to resolve the dispute if the dispute resolution process fails to do so.

Eliminates certain conditions on tribes or tribal organizations using funds under such Act for job creation and economic development activities. Requires, instead, that those expenditures be consistent with their plan.

Requires employers that place plan participants in training positions to prioritize the provision of permanent employment to those participants if they successfully complete the training period. (Currently, they are to guarantee employment to those participants for at least one year.)

Gives the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) 20 days after the receipt of funds from the appropriate federal department or agency to transfer them to participating tribes or tribal organizations.

Expands the number of federal departments required to enter into an interdepartmental memorandum of agreement providing for the implementation of such Act.

Requires transferred amounts to be spent on activities authorized under a plan, rather than requiring them to be spent on allowable activities under the program from which the funds were transferred.</summary>
