  <summary>3/20/2013--Introduced.
Safe Prescribing Act of 2013 - Amends the Controlled Substances Act to remove dihydrocodeinone (hydrocodone) from classification as a schedule III controlled substance.

Directs the Attorney General to immediately allow manufacturers and distributors to store hydrocodone combination products in accordance with the physical security requirements for schedule III, IV, and V controlled substances for three years beginning on the date of enactment of this Act.

Requires the Comptroller General to submit a report on the reclassification of hydrocodone products under this Act, including: (1) an assessment of the degree to which the reclassification of such products under this Act impacts the ability of patients with legitimate medical needs, particularly those in rural areas and nursing home facilities, to access adequate pain management; and (2) recommendations necessary to address any issues relating to patient access to adequate pain management.</summary>
