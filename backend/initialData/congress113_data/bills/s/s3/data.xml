Strengthen our Schools and Students Act - Expresses the sense of the Senate that Congress should:

 strengthen early learning programs to better prepare children for success in school; ensure that all students have equitable access to a high-quality, well-rounded education that prepares them to succeed in college and a career; continue efforts to make higher education more affordable and to improve access and success for all students; provide all teachers with the support they need to ensure student success, including by creating a national Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Master Teacher Corps; and support states and local educational agencies to ensure that schools have safe and successful learning conditions.</summary>
