  <summary>1/22/2013--Introduced.
Immigration Reform that Works for America's Future Act - Expresses the sense of the Senate that Congress should:

 create a roadmap for immigrants who are here without legal status to earn citizenship, provided they pay taxes, complete a background check, learn English, and show a commitment to America; allow students who came to America as children to earn citizenship by attending college or joining the Armed Forces; protect the sustainability of the American agricultural industry, including the dairy industry, with a stable and legal agricultural workforce; encourage those who seek to invest in the United States and create American jobs; permit individuals who earn an advanced degree from one of our universities to remain in the United States, rather than using that education to work for our international competitors; fulfill and strengthen our nation's commitments regarding security along our borders and at our ports of entry; strengthen our nation's historic humanitarian tradition of welcoming asylum seekers and refugees and improve existing policies that support immigrant victims of crime and domestic violence; create an effective electronic verification system and strengthen enforcement to prevent employers from hiring people illegally; implement a legal immigration system that promotes job creation by converting the current flow of illegal immigrants into the United States into a more manageable and legal process for admitting immigrants while, at the same time, safeguarding the jobs, rights, and wages of American workers; and adopt practical and fair immigration reforms to help ensure family unity.</summary>
