  <summary>3/12/2013--Introduced.
Amends the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) to require a convening authority (the official acting on the sentence of a court-martial), when taking any action other than approving a sentence, to prepare a written justification of such action which shall be made part of the record of the court-martial.

Prohibits a convening authority (or person acting in such capacity) from: (1) dismissing or setting aside a finding of guilty, or (2) reducing a finding of guilty to a finding of guilty to a lesser included offense. Repeals an inconsistent UCMJ provision.</summary>
