  <summary>5/23/2013--Introduced.
Families for Foster Youth Stamp Act of 2013 - Requires the United States Postal Service, for a period of at least four years, to provide for the issuance and sale of a semipostal in order to increase funding for effective programs targeted at improving permanency outcomes for youth in foster care.

Divides the amount received from such sales equally between: (1) programs and activities under the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment and Adoption Reform Act of 1978 that specifically target improvement in permanency outcomes for youth in foster care through adoption, guardianship, or kinship care; and (2) the program for state courts to assess and improve handling of proceedings relating to foster care and adoption.</summary>
