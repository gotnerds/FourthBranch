Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program Reauthorization Act of 2013 - Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to: (1) extend through FY2018 the authorization of appropriations for the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program; (2) transfer to the Treasury, no later than January 15, 2016, all previously appropriated funds for such program that are not expended by September 30, 2015; (3) prohibit a state, local government, or Indian tribe from using any funding under another grant program to pay or defer the cost of the matching fund requirement for the grant program; (4) require a grantee to comply with any established requirements for the use of such grants, have a written policy requiring uniformed patrol officers to wear an armor vest or body armor, and use funds for purchasing vests or body armor that meet performance standards established by the Bureau of Justice Assistance; and (5) allow preferential consideration in grant awards to jurisdictions that provide armor vests to law enforcement officers that are uniquely fitted for such officers, including individual female officers.

Expresses the sense of Congress that amounts made available to carry out the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program should be made available through the end of the fiscal year following the one for which the amounts are appropriated and should not be made available until expended by the Department of Justice (DOJ).</summary>
