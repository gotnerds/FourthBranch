  <summary>3/12/2014--Introduced.
Smart Savings Act - Makes the default investment in the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) an age-appropriate target date asset allocation portfolio (L Fund), instead of the Government Securities Investment Fund (G Fund), if no election has been made for the investment of available funds. Retains the Government Securities Investment Fund as the default fund for members of the uniformed services. Requires TSP participants whose default fund is an age-appropriate L Fund to sign a risk acknowledgement before beginning TSP contributions.</summary>
