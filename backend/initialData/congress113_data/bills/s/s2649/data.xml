  <summary>7/23/2014--Introduced.
Declares that, for purposes of U.S. law and for activities undertaken within the jurisdiction of the United States, no verdict, order, warrant, or writ issued by the government of Egypt or any court, administrative tribunal, or other Egyptian authority relating to the legal charges, trial proceedings, and convictions issued by the Cairo Criminal Court on June 4, 2013, in Public Prosecution Case No. 1110 for the Year 2012 against 43 staff of five international nongovernmental organizations shall be considered a conviction, and no person named in such verdict, order, warrant, or writ shall be considered to have been charged, accused, found guilty, or convicted.

States that it is U.S. policy to recognize any related legal charges, trial proceedings, and convictions as being politically motivated and invalid.</summary>
