Authorizes the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) to issue to a veteran a card, to be known as a Veterans ID Card, that identifies the veteran as a veteran and includes the veteran's name and photo. Allows the Secretary to issue such a card regardless of whether the veteran is: (1) enrolled in the VA system of annual patient enrollment; or (2) in receipt of VA educational assistance, compensation, or pension.

Authorizes the Secretary to work with national retail chains that offer veterans reduced prices on pharmaceutical and consumer products to ensure that such chains recognize the above cards when offering such prices.</summary>
