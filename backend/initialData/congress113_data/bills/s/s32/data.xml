  <summary>1/22/2013--Introduced.
Child Custody Protection Act of 2013 - Amends the federal criminal code to prohibit knowingly transporting a minor child across a state line to obtain an abortion (deems such transporting to be a de facto abridgment of the right of a parent under any law in the minor's state of residence that requires parental involvement in the minor's abortion decision). Makes an exception for an abortion necessary to save the life of the minor.

Makes it an affirmative defense to a prosecution or civil action under this Act that a defendant reasonably believed that before the minor obtained the abortion, the required parental consent or notification or judicial authorization took place.

Imposes a fine and/or prison term of up to one year on anyone who has committed an act of incest with a minor and knowingly transports such minor across a state line to obtain an abortion.</summary>
