  <summary>3/11/2014--Introduced.
Developing an Innovative Strategy for Antimicrobial Resistant Microorganisms Act of 2014 or DISARM Act of 2014 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to: (1) recognize the costs of new antimicrobial drugs under the Medicare payment system for the inpatient services of subsection (d) hospitals, (2) provide for additional payment with respect to discharges involving such drugs, (3) publish in the Federal Register a list of the new antimicrobial drugs, and (4) further reduce each of the average standardized payment amounts in a specified manner to maintain budget neutrality in a fiscal year beginning with FY2015.

(Generally, a subsection [d] hospital is an acute care hospital, particularly one that receives payments under Medicare's inpatient prospective payment system [IPPS] when providing covered inpatient services to eligible beneficiaries.)

Directs the Comptroller General (GAO) to study the barriers that prevent the development of new antimicrobial drugs and develop recommendations for actions to be taken in order to overcome such barriers.</summary>
