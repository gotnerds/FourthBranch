Jobs Score Act of 2013 - Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to require a Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analysis of any public bill or resolution reported from a congressional committee (except each chamber's Committee on Appropriations) to estimate the number of jobs which would be created, sustained, or lost in carrying out such measure in the fiscal year in which it is to become effective and in each of the four ensuing fiscal years, together with the basis for each such estimate.

Requires such analysis, to the extent practicable, to include regional and state-level estimates of such jobs.</summary>
