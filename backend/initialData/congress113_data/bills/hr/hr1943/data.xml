  <summary>5/9/2013--Introduced.
Super Pollutant Emissions Reduction Act of 2013 or the SUPER Act of 2013 - Requires the President to establish the Task Force on Super Pollutants to:

 review existing and potential policies and measures that promote reduction of short-lived climate pollutants, in part by identifying and evaluating programs and activities of the federal government that contribute to such reduction; identify and recommend specific existing programs and activities that are duplicative and that can be consolidated to achieve greater efficiency and effectiveness; identify gaps where programs do not exist and recommend focused programs and activities to fill such gaps to achieve reductions of short-lived climate pollutants, with an emphasis on industry standards and public-private partnerships; identify, compile, evaluate, and develop best practices for reductions of short-lived climate pollutants; and report to Congress on its findings and recommendations. Defines "short-lived climate pollutant" as black carbon, methane, hydrofluorocarbons, tropospheric ozone and its precursors, or emissions from banks of ozone-depleting substances.</summary>
