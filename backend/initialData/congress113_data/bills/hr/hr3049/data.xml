  <summary>8/2/2013--Introduced.
Justice for Fort Hood and Little Rock Heroes Act - Requires an individual who, while a member of the Armed Forces, was killed or wounded in the attack at Fort Hood, Texas, on November 5, 2009, or in the attack at the recruiting station in Little Rock, Arkansas, on June 1, 2009, to be treated as if the individual has been awarded a Purple Heart as of the date of this Act's enactment for purposes of all applicable federal laws, regulations, and policies.

Requires such an individual who was wounded in either such attack to be treated as an "eligible combat-related disabled uniformed services retiree" for purposes of determining that individual's eligibility for combat-related special compensation.

Disqualifies an individual whose death or wound was the result of the individual's willful misconduct.

Encourages each state and local government to treat such an individual as eligible for any benefits provided to individuals by reason of being killed or wounded while serving in the line of duty as a member of the Armed Forces.</summary>
