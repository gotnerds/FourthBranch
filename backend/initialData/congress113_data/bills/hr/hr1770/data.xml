  <summary>4/26/2013--Introduced.
Makes the Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) annuity for survivors of members of the reserves who die from an injury or illness incurred or aggravated in the line of duty during inactive-duty training the same as such annuity for survivors of members of the regular Armed Forces who die in the line of duty while on active duty. Provides the same increase with respect to the payment of an SBP annuity to a dependent child or children when there is no eligible surviving spouse.

Directs the Secretary of Defense (DOD) to adjust SBP payment amounts to reflect such changes.</summary>
