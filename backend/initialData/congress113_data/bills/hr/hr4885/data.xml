Social Impact Bond Act - Amends title XX (Block Grants to States for Social Services and Elder Justice) of the Social Security Act to add a new part C (Social Impact Bonds).

Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to seek proposals from states or local governments for social impact bond projects which produce measurable, clearly defined outcomes that result in social benefit, such as employment for the unemployed, high school graduation, and reduction of teen and unplanned pregnancies as well as incidences of child abuse and neglect.

Requires the Secretary, within six months after receiving an application, to determine whether to enter into a contract for a social impact bond project with a state or local government.

Requires independent evaluation of a state or local government social impact bond project.

Establishes the Federal Interagency Council on Social Impact Bonds.

Amends the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 to require the appropriate federal financial supervisory agency to consider, in assessing and taking into account the record of a financial institution in meeting the credit needs of its entire community, its investments in social impact bond projects.</summary>
