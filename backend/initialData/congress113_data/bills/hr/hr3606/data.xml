  <summary>11/21/2013--Introduced.
Emigrant Wilderness Historical Use Preservation Act of 2013 - Declares that this Act modifies and supplements federal law applicable to the Emigrant Wilderness of the Stanislaus National Forest in California.

Directs the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA) to ensure that, within the Emigrant Wilderness, the level of use, allotted user days, and activities by commercial outfitters and guides shall not rise above or be restricted below the historical level of use, allotted user days, and activities by commercial outfitters and guides within that area that existed as of the original designation of the Wilderness on January 3, 1975.

Prohibits any increase or reduction in the level of commercial pack and saddle stock use from the highest level of such use in the preceding 10 years.

Allows the historical use of trails, roads, paths, campsites, meadows, and cross-country areas in the Wilderness by recreational and commercial pack and saddle stock to continue.

States that the use of drift fences that are in existence or were previously in existence at the time of the Wilderness' designation shall be allowed and maintained.</summary>
