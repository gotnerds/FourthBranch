  <summary>8/1/2013--Introduced.
Domestic Energy Production Protection Act of 2013 - Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to submit for analysis by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) a proposed rule or guidance under the Clean Air Act that may reduce the level of energy output in a specified sector before such a rule or guidance may take effect. Defines "specified sector" as one of the nine sectors of energy production listed in the document entitled "Annual Energy Outlook 2013: With Projections to 2040," published by the U.S. Energy Information Administration in April 2013.

Requires the Administrator of OIRA (Administrator), within 90 days of receiving the proposed rule or guidance, to conduct an analysis to determine if such rule or guidance, individually or when combined with another final rule or guidance issued by EPA, will reduce the level of energy output in a specified sector below the level of the prior year. Requires such analysis to include the potential impact of the rule or guidance on energy output in such sectors and any potential job losses over a period of 10 years.

Requires the Administrator to report to Congress after making a determination that a proposed rule or guidance would reduce such energy output. Prohibits such rule or guidance that is the subject of a report from taking effect unless Congress enacts a joint resolution approving it. Establishes a process for approving a rule or guidance by a joint resolution.

Removes rules promulgated pursuant to this Act from the established process for review of agency rulemaking, if a rulemaking will reduce energy output.

Defines "energy output" as the level of production for a year, measured in quadrillion Btu, as calculated and included in such document.</summary>
