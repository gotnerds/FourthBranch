  <summary>4/3/2014--Introduced.
Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to designate maternity care health professional shortage areas and review such designations at least annually.

Requires the Secretary to collect and publish data on health care professional shortage areas based on professional category of maternal health professionals providing full scope maternity health care by provider type as well as geographic region.

Includes, in the criteria for designation of health professional shortage areas, consideration of health professionals other than physicians who provide full scope maternity care and are eligible for National Health Service Corps loan repayment.

Defines "maternity care health professional shortage area" to mean: (1) an area determined to have a shortage of providers of full scope maternity care health services or of hospital or birth center labor and delivery units, or (2) a population group determined to have a shortage of such providers or facilities.

Defines "full scope maternity care health services" to include care during labor, birthing, prenatal care, and postpartum care.</summary>
