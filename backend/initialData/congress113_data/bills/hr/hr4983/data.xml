  <summary>6/26/2014--Introduced.
Strengthening Transparency in Higher Education Act - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) to eliminate the restriction of college cost calculations to those costs incurred by first-time students.

Eliminates the requirement that the Secretary of Education make publicly available on the College Navigator website: (1) college affordability and transparency lists, and (2) state higher education spending charts.

Requires that the Secretary develop, annually update, and make publicly available a College Dashboard website that displays the following information regarding each institution of higher education (IHE) participating in the programs under title IV (Student Assistance) of the HEA:

 a link to the IHE's website; an identification of the IHE's type; the number of students enrolled at the IHE; the student-faculty ratio; the percentage of degree- or certificate-seeking undergraduate students at the IHE who obtain a certificate within the normal time for completing their program, within 150% of that time period, and within 200% of that time period; the average net price per year for undergraduate students at the IHE and a link to the net price calculator for the IHE; the average student loan debt incurred by undergraduate students in the course of obtaining a certificate or degree from the IHE; the IHE's cohort default rate; and a link to national and regional data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) on starting salaries in all major occupations. Directs the Secretary to publish more detailed and disaggregated IHE information regarding student enrollment, completion rates, costs, and use of financial aid on Internet web pages that are linked to through the College Dashboard website.

Requires the Secretary to: (1) include on the College Dashboard website a function enabling users to easily compare information between IHEs, and (2) provide each student who submits a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) with a link to the web page of the College Dashboard website that contains information for each IHE on the student's FAFSA.</summary>
