Extinguishes any aboriginal title held by the Tribe, or any predecessor in interest or any of its members, to the land or natural resources the transfer of which is approved and ratified by this Act.

Extinguishes any claim by or on behalf of the Tribe, or any predecessor in interest or any of its members, against Texas or the United States regarding the transferred or aboriginal lands or natural resources.

Requires the United States and the Tribe to execute and file with the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas a motion for entry of final judgment in accordance with the terms of this Act of pending litigation regarding the government's failure to discharge its fiduciary duty to the Tribe.</summary>
