  <summary>2/13/2013--Introduced.
Bankruptcy Nondiscrimination Enhancement Act of 2013 - Amends the federal bankruptcy code to prohibit private employers from denying employment to: (1) an individual who is or has been a debtor under either the bankruptcy code or the Bankruptcy Act, or (2) an individual associated with such debtor or bankrupt.

Eliminates from such prohibition the limitation applying it to a denial or termination of employment solely on the basis of debtor status (thus applying the prohibition to any case in which debtor status is not the sole basis for discrimination).</summary>
