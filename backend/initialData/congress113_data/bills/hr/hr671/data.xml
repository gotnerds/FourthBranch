  <summary>6/4/2013--Passed House amended.
(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on May 17, 2013. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Ruth Moore Act of 2013 - Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) to report to Congress in each of 2014 through 2018 on claims submitted for disabilities based on a covered mental health condition alleged to have been incurred or aggravated by military sexual trauma during active duty. Includes as a covered mental health condition post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression, or any other mental health diagnosis that the Secretary determines to be related to military sexual trauma.

Expresses the sense of Congress that the Secretary should update and improve VA regulations with respect to military sexual trauma by: (1) ensuring that it is specified as an in-service stressor in determining the service-connection of PTSD, and (2) recognizing the full range of physical and mental disabilities that can result from such trauma. Requires each veteran submitting such a claim to be provided the most recently updated regulations concerning such trauma, as well as other information designed to aid such claims.

Extends until FY2019 the required rounding to the nearest dollar of VA basic educational assistance and survivors' and dependents' educational assistance.</summary>
