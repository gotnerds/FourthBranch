  <summary>3/27/2014--Introduced.
Requires the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to publish a cost-benefit analysis before issuing any decision that would either: (1) authorize creation of a new capacity zone, or (2) affect the supply and demand curves or models used to determine prices at points in a capacity zone.

Prohibits FERC from issuing any such decision if it determines that such analysis shows that costs will be raised for ratepayers.</summary>
