  <summary>11/15/2013--Introduced.
Veterans and Armed Forces Health Promotion Act of 2013 - Requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of Defense (DOD) to jointly develop and implement: (1) a plan to expand materially and substantially the scope of research and education on, and delivery of holistic care that includes, the integration of appropriate complementary and alternative medicine interventions in the delivery of health care to veterans and members of the Armed Forces at military medical treatment facilities; and (2) a three-year pilot program to establish not fewer than five jointly-operated medical treatment and research facilities.

Requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to carry out: (1) a 3-year pilot program, through the Office of Patient Centered Care and Cultural Transformation of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), to assess the feasibility and advisability of establishing not fewer than 10 complementary and alternative medicine centers within VA medical centers to promote the use and integration of complementary and alternative medicine services for mental health diagnoses and pain management; (2) a 3-year pilot program, through grants to nonprofit entities, to assess the feasibility and advisability of using wellness programs at VA facilities to complement the provision of mental health care to veterans and family members eligible for counseling; (3) a 3-year pilot program, through the National Center for Preventive Health, to assess the feasibility and advisability of promoting health in covered veterans at not less than 15 VA medical centers through support for fitness center membership or medical nutrition therapy; and (4) a 2-year pilot program under which the Secretary makes grants to nonprofit veterans services organizations (VSOs) to upgrade VSO community facilities into health and wellness centers in at least 10 different geographic locations.</summary>
