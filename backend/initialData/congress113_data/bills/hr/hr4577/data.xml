  <summary>5/6/2014--Introduced.
Ensuring Seniors Access to Local Pharmacies Act of 2014 - Amends part D (Voluntary Prescription Drug Benefit Program) of title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act with respect to a prescription drug plan that has, in its network of pharmacies, one or more pharmacies located in a health professional shortage area, in a medically underserved area, or among a medically underserved population, and that provides a reduction in coinsurance or copayments for covered part D drugs dispensed through them.

Declares that such a plan shall extend to any pharmacy located in that area or among that population the option to be an in-network pharmacy with respect to such plan under terms and conditions comparable to those the plan has agreed upon with other in-network pharmacies located in the area or among that population.</summary>
