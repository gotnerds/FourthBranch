  <summary>5/9/2014--Introduced.
Bereaved Borrowers' Bill of Rights Act of 2014 - Amends the Truth in Lending Act to require a private educational lender to include in a private education loan for which the cosigner is jointly liable a process for releasing the cosigner from obligations on such loan.

 Requires a lender who receives notification of the death or bankruptcy of a cosigner who is jointly liable for the loan to notify the borrower about the borrower's rights under the loan agreement regarding: (1) release of the cosigner, and (2) identification of a new cosigner or refinancing of the loan.

 Amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to prohibit: (1) consumer reporting agencies from containing in any consumer report default on a private education loan that results from accelerated repayment terms of the loan after the death or bankruptcy of a jointly liable cosigner, and (2) the lender or servicer of a private educational loan from furnishing loan information to a consumer reporting agency if the consumer defaulted on the loan due to accelerated repayment terms after the death or bankruptcy of such a cosigner.</summary>
