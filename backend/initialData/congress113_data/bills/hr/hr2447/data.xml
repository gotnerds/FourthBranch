American Manufacturing Competitiveness Act of 2013 - Directs the Committee on Technology under the National Science and Technology Council to develop, in lieu of the currently required strategic plan to guide federal programs and activities in support of advanced manufacturing research and development, a national manufacturing competitiveness strategic plan to improve government coordination and provide long-term guidance for federal programs and activities in support of U.S. manufacturing competitiveness, including advanced manufacturing research and development.

Requires the Secretary of Commerce, in developing and updating the plan quadrennially, to serve as the chairperson of the Committee.

Specifies the goals of the plan to be to: (1) promote growth in the U.S. manufacturing sector, (2) support the development of a skilled manufacturing workforce, (3) enable innovation and investment in domestic manufacturing, and (4) support national security.

Requires the Committee, as part of the development of the plan, to conduct an analysis of specified factors that impact the competitiveness and growth of the U.S. manufacturing sector.

Requires the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy to transmit the plan, and subsequent updates, to Congress.</summary>
