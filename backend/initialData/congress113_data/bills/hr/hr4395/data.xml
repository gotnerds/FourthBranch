  <summary>4/3/2014--Introduced.
Action for Dental Health Act 2014 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to award grants to or enter into contracts with eligible entities to obtain portable or mobile dental equipment and to pay for appropriate operational costs for the provision of free dental services to underserved populations that are delivered in a manner consistent with state licensing laws.

Directs the Secretary to award grants to or enter into contracts with eligible entities to collaborate with state, county, or local public officials and other stakeholders in order to develop and implement initiatives to: (1) improve oral health education and dental disease prevention; (2) reduce barriers in a manner that increases dental provider participation in Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP); (3) make the health care delivery system providing dental services under Medicaid or CHIP more accessible and efficient by taking actions necessary to facilitate the establishment of dental homes; (4) address geographic, language, cultural, and similar barriers in the provision of dental services; and (5) reduce the use of emergency departments for dental services more appropriately delivered in a dental primary care setting.</summary>
