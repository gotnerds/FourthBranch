  <summary>10/30/2013--Introduced.
Housing Native Heroes Act of 2013 - Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to authorize the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to carry out a rental assistance and supportive housing demonstration program, in conjunction with the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA), for the benefit of Indian veterans who are homeless or at-risk of homelessness and who are residing on or near Indian lands.

Requires rental assistance under such program to be: (1) made available through recipients eligible for housing assistance block grants under the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996; and (2) awarded based on need, administrative capacity, and any other funding criteria established by the HUD Secretary in a notice published in the Federal Register after consulting with the VA Secretary.</summary>
