  <summary>2/27/2013--Introduced.
Requires the Assistant Administrator of the Office of Research and Development at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to: (1) enter into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences to provide a comprehensive assessment of research on the implications of the use of mid-level ethanol blends (defined as an ethanol-gasoline blend containing greater than 10% and up to and including 20% ethanol by volume that is intended to be used in any conventional gasoline-powered motor vehicle or nonroad vehicle or engine), comparing mid-level ethanol blends to gasoline blends containing 10% and 0% ethanol; and (2) report on the findings of such assessment and on the agreement or disagreement of the Administrator of EPA with each of such findings.

Nullifies waivers granted under the Clean Air Act before this Act's enactment that allow the introduction into commerce of mid-level ethanol blends for use in motor vehicles and prohibits the Administrator from granting any new waivers until after such report is submitted. Requires such assessment to include: (1) an evaluation of the environmental, safety, durability, and performance effects of the introduction of mid-level blends on onroad, nonroad, and marine engines, onroad and nonroad vehicles, and related equipment; and (2) an identification of areas of research, development, and testing necessary to ensure that existing motor fuel infrastructure is not adversely impacted by mid-level ethanol blends and to reduce the risk of misfueling by users at various points in the distribution and supply chain.</summary>
