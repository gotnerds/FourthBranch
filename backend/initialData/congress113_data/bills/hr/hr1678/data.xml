  <summary>4/23/2013--Introduced.
Saving Essential American Sailors Act or SEAS Act - Amends the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) to repeal the Act's repeal of the agricultural export requirements that: (1) 25% of the gross tonnage of certain agricultural commodities or their products exported each fiscal year be transported on U.S. commercial vessels, and (2) the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) finance any increased ocean freight charges incurred in the transportation of such items.

Revives and reinstates those repealed requirements to read as if they were never repealed.</summary>
