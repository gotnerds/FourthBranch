(Under current law, selected locations also must include any location other than one described above in an area that contains a high concentration of veterans with traumatic brain injuries.)\n\nExpands requirements for reports on the pilot program.\n\nReplaces references to \"assisted living\" with the term \"community-based brain injury residential rehabilitative care,\" including rehabilitation services within the meaning of such care.\n\nRequires a veteran, in order to be eligible for such services, to have a traumatic brain injury that is classified as complex-mild to severe.\n\nModifies the process of recovery of the costs of certain care for a non-service-connected disability to allow a veteran's medical records to be made available to third parties without written consent if the care or services are related to drug abuse, alcoholism or alcohol abuse, HIV infection, or sickle cell anemia and the veteran does not withhold consent for such disclosure within 30 days of receiving such care."
