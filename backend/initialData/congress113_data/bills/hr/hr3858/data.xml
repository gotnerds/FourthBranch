  <summary>1/13/2014--Introduced.
Veteran-Centered Access to Coordinated Health Care Act of 2014 - Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) to provide certain enrolled veterans with health services (authorized hospital care or medical, rehabilitative, or preventive health services) that are provided by a non-VA provider with whom the Secretary enters into a contract if the Secretary determines that VA facilities are incapable of furnishing such services because of: (1) geographical inaccessibility; or (2) a lack of required personnel or ability to provide timely and reasonable access.

Specifies the order of priority of locations for such non-VA providers.

Sets forth requirements concerning VA care coordination with such providers and provider performance metrics.

Amends the Veterans' Mental Health and Other Care Improvements Act of 2008 to reauthorize, for three years, a VA pilot program of contract care authority within each Veterans Integrated Service Network for the health care needs of veterans in highly rural areas.</summary>
