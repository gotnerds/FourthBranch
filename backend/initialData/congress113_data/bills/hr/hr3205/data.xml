  <summary>10/22/2013--Passed House without amendment.
Promoting Adoption and Legal Guardianship for Children in Foster Care Act - Title I: Adoption Incentives Grant Program - (Sec. 101) Amends part E (Foster Care and Adoption Assistance) of title IV of the Social Security Act (SSA) to revise the adoption incentives grant program (renaming it the adoption and legal guardianship incentive program), creating a new formula for determining adoption incentive payments, and extending the program through FY2016.

(Sec.104) Requires states to use amounts paid to them under such program to supplement, and not supplant, any federal or non-federal funds used to provide any service under SSA title IV parts B (Child and Family Services) or E.

(Sec. 104) Increases from 24 to 36 the number of months during which incentive program payments are available for expenditure.

(Sec. 106) Requires states to: (1) report annually to the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) on the calculation and use of savings resulting from the application of certain requirements to all children, and (2) spend at least 20% of such savings on post-adoption services.

(Sec. 107) Provides that in the event of the death or incapacity of the relative guardian, the eligibility of a child for a kinship guardianship assistance payment shall not be affected because of the replacement of the relative guardian with a successor legal guardian named in the kinship guardianship assistance agreement.

Title II: Extension of Family Connection Grant Program - (Sec. 201) Amends SSA title IV part B to extend the family connection grant program through FY2016.

Title III: Unemployment Compensation - (Sec. 301) Amends SSA title III (Unemployment Insurance) with respect to the requirement that a state have an unemployment compensation law containing certain provisions in order to receive a specified federal grant. Requires a state owed an unemployment compensation debt meeting specified criteria that remains uncollected within two years after it was first incurred to take specified action under the Internal Revenue Code to recover it, including through a tax refund offset.</summary>
