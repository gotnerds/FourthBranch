  <summary>2/11/2014--Introduced.
Renewable Fuel Utilization, Expansion, and Leadership Act or the REFUEL Act - Amends the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a renewable and alternative energy infrastructure competitive grant program.

Makes eligible for such grants projects that are: (1) for new infrastructure or retrofitting existing infrastructure for the dispensing of covered renewable or alternative energy for retail consumption, and (2) capable of dispensing fuel containing an amount of covered renewable or alternative energy that is higher than ordinarily found in commerce.

Requires that priority be given to projects in rural areas and that entities receiving grants provide at least a 30% match of federal funds.

Dedicates to the grant program 1% of amounts received as royalties for production of oil from oil and gas leases under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. Defines "covered renewable or alternative energy" as renewable energy, energy intended for use in electric vehicle charging, and hydrogen and fuel cells.</summary>
