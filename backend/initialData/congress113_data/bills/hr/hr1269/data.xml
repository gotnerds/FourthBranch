Life, Liberty, and Justice for All Americans Act - Prohibits the President from using lethal military force against a U.S. citizen located in the United States.

Provides an exception if the President determines that: (1) the individual poses an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury to another individual, and (2) using such force will prevent or minimize such death or injury.

States that nothing in this Act shall be construed to allow the killing of a U.S. citizen without due process of law.</summary>
