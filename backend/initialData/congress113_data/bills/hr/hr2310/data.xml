  <summary>6/11/2013--Introduced.
Guard Units and Reservists Deserve Remembrance Act - Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) to make available for purchase a memorial headstone or marker for the marked or unmarked grave of: (1) an individual who performed inactive duty training or active duty for training as a member of a National Guard or Reserve component for at least six years, but did not serve on active duty and is not otherwise ineligible for a memorial headstone or marker on account of the nature of the individual's separation from the Armed Forces or other cause; or (2) such an individual whose remains are unavailable.

Permits such a headstone or marker to be purchased under this Act by: (1) the individual; (2) the surviving spouse, child, sibling, or parent of the individual; or (3) an individual other than the next of kin, as determined by the Secretary.

Directs the Secretary to: (1) ensure that the prices of such headstones and markers are sufficient to cover their production and delivery costs, and (2) coordinate with the Secretary of Defense (DOD) in establishing procedures to determine whether an individual qualifies for the purchase of a memorial headstone or marker under this Act.</summary>
