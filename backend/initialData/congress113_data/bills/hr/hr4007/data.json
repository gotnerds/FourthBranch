Defines \"covered chemical facility\" to mean a chemical facility that the Secretary designates as a facility of interest and determines presents a high level of security risk, with specified exceptions.\n\nRequires: (1) information developed pursuant to this Act to be protected from public disclosure, but permits the sharing of such information with state and local government officials possessing the necessary security clearances; and (2) information submitted to or obtained by the Secretary under this Act to be treated as classified material.\n\nSets forth civil penalties for violations of orders issued under this Act.\n\n Terminates this Act two years after its enactment."
