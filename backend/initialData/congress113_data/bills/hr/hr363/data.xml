  <summary>1/23/2013--Introduced.
District of Columbia House Equal Representation Act of 2013 - Treats the District of Columbia as a state for purposes of representation in the House of Representatives.

Applies to the District in the same manner as it applies to a state the federal law providing for the 15th and subsequent decennial censuses and for apportionment of Representatives in Congress.

Modifies the formula regarding the number of presidential electors to subject it to the 23rd amendment to the Constitution in the case of the District.

Increases membership of the House from 435 to 436 Members. Provides for a reapportionment of Members resulting from such increase.

Repeals provisions of: (1) the District of Columbia Delegate Act establishing the office of District of Columbia Delegate to the House of Representatives, and (2) the District of Columbia Statehood Constitution Convention Initiative of 1979 providing for election of a Representative for the District.

Makes conforming amendments to the District of Columbia Elections Code of 1955.

Sets forth procedures for expedited judicial review of any action brought to challenge the constitutionality of any provision of this Act or any amendment made by it.</summary>
