  <summary>3/14/2014--Introduced.
Forest Access in Rural Communities Act - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA), through the Forest Sevice, to cease all implementation and enforcement of the travel management rule for units of the National Forest System derived from the public domain to the extent that it will, or can reasonably be expected to, alter public access to such lands.

Requires the Secretary, as a condition on the preparation of an environmental impact statement or environmental assessment under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) for a proposed access travel management action, to consult with affected counties for the purpose of incorporating their needs, uses, and input.

Bars the Secretary from implementing an access travel management action, unless and until, the Secretary: (1) complies with the consultation requirement imposed by this Act, and (2) obtains the concurrence of each affected county for the implementation of such action.</summary>
