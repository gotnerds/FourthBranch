  <summary>4/9/2013--Introduced.
Truth in Healthcare Marketing Act of 2013 - Prohibits any person from making any deceptive or misleading statement, or engaging in any deceptive or misleading act, that: (1) misrepresents whether such person holds a state health care license; or (2) misrepresents such person's education, training, degree, license, or clinical expertise.

Requires any person who is advertising health care services provided by such person to disclose the applicable license under which such person is authorized to provide those services.

Deems a violation of this Act to be an unfair or deceptive act or practice under the Federal Trade Commission Act.

Directs the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to study and report to Congress on health care professionals' misrepresentations under this Act.

Declares that nothing in this Act shall be construed or have the effect of changing state scope of practice for any health care professional.</summary>
