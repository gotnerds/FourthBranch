Amends the Internal Revenue Code, with respect to tax-exempt qualified tuition programs (529 plans), to: (1) make permanent the allowance for computer technology and equipment expenses and require that such technology and equipment&#160;be used primarily by the plan beneficiary (formerly, beneficiary and beneficiary's family); (2) allow contributors to a 529 plan or a plan beneficiary to direct plan investments, but not more frequently than four times per calendar year; (3) permit a recontribution to a 529 plan&#160;of amounts refunded to a student who withdraws from an educational institution&#160;if the recontribution is made not later than 60 days after the date of such refund and does not exceed the refunded amount; and (4) allow&#160;tax-free rollovers to a Roth individual retirement account (Roth IRA) of distributions from a qualified tuition program which has been maintained by&#160;the account holder for a 10-year period.</summary>
