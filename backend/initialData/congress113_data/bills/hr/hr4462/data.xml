  <summary>4/10/2014--Introduced.
Housing Financial Literacy Act of 2014 - Amends the National Housing Act to revise the single insurance premium payment for a mortgage (secured by a one- to four-family dwelling that is an obligation of the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund) of a first-time homebuyer who completes a program of counseling on the responsibilities and financial management involved in homeownership that is approved by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).

Repeals the current maximum premium payment of 2.75% of the amount of the mortgage's original insured principal obligation.

Sets the single mortgage insurance premium payment at 25 basis points lower than the premium payment amount otherwise established.</summary>
