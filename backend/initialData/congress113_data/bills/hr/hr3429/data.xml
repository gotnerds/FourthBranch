  <summary>10/30/2013--Introduced.
Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to require an entity designated by or awarded funds by a health care exchange for the operation of a Navigator program under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, to facilitate enrollment in health plans, or to advocate for enrolling certain populations to certify (and periodically recertify) that it has in place appropriate policies and safeguards: (1) to protect any personally identifiable information and financial information, and (2) prohibiting employment of individuals who have been convicted of identity fraud or theft offenses or a dishonesty or breach of trust felony involving insurance.

 Requires the Secretary to disqualify an entity in violation of such policies from eligibility for designation and receipt of funds under the exchange assistance provisions and to certify compliance with this Act to Congress annually.</summary>
