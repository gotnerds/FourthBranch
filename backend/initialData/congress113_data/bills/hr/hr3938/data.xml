Directs the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) to designate natural gas fueling corridors in the United States for long haul truck traffic.

Requires the Secretary, in designating these corridors, to: (1) seek to establish an interconnection of natural gas fueling stations across the United States that will serve the highest possible volume of long haul truck traffic; (2) take into consideration the location of existing natural gas fueling stations, with the goal of having them located no more than 200 miles apart in such corridors; and (3) provide public notice and an opportunity for comment.</summary>
