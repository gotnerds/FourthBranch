Permits the location of such measures within such segments.\n\n Limits the authority of the Secretary to acquire lands under this Act to acquisition by donation or with the owner's consent, and subject to additional management plan criteria.\n\nBars the Missisquoi and Trout Rivers from being administered as part of the National Park System or being subject to System regulations."
