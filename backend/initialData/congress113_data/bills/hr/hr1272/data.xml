Maple Tapping Access Program Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA) to make grants to states, tribal governments, and research institutions to promote the domestic maple syrup industry through: (1) promotion of research and education, (2) promotion of natural resource sustainability, (3) market promotion, and (4) encouragement of owners and operators of privately held land to initiate or expand maple-sugaring activities or to voluntarily make the land available to the public for maple-sugaring activities.

Defines "maple-sugaring" as the collection of sap from any species of tree in the genus Acer for the purpose of boiling to produce food.

 States that nothing in this Act shall be construed to preempt a state or tribal government law, including a state or tribal government liability law.</summary>
