  <summary>11/21/2013--Introduced.
Malala Yousafzai Scholarship Act - Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) every individual, regardless of gender, should have the opportunity to pursue an education free from the fear of discrimination; and (2) educational exchanges promote institutional linkages between the United States and Pakistan.

Encourages the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to continue to support Pakistani education initiatives, especially those for women.

Directs the USAID Administrator to increase the number of scholarships to women under the Merit and Needs-Based Scholarship Program (Program) during each of calendar years 2013 through 2015 over the level awarded to women in calendar year 2011. (The Program awards scholarships for university study to academically talented, financially needy Pakistani students.)

Requires the additional scholarships to be awarded: (1) in accordance with existing scholarship criteria, and (2) for a range of disciplines to improve the employability of graduates and to meet the needs of the scholarship recipients.

 Directs the USAID Administrator to make every effort to award 50% of the scholarships available under the Program to Pakistani women.</summary>
