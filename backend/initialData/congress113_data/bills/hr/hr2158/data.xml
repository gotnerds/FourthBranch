  <summary>5/23/2013--Introduced.
Expedited Departure of Certain Snake Species Act - Requires a qualified stop of a covered snake (Burmese python, Indian python, Northern African python, Southern African python, and Yellow anaconda) to be treated as occurring in interstate commerce for purposes of the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981.

Defines a "qualified stop": (1) as any intermediate stop in an airport of a covered snake in a secure container in the course of transport of such snake that begins in an airport located at a designated port (as defined in regulations by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service on importing, exporting, and transporting wildlife) and ends at a place outside of the United States no later than 48 hours after such transport begins; and (2) to exclude any stop in Hawaii. Authorizes such stop to include: (1) a stop to refuel or take on additional cargo or passengers at an airport that is not a designated airport; or (2) a transfer of the secure container in an airport between aircraft used for such transport outside of the United States.</summary>
