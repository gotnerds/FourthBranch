  <summary>2/14/2013--Introduced.
Pest Elimination Services Transparency and Terminology or the PESTT Act - Amends the Rural Development, Agriculture, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1988, with respect to nuisance animal control activities and agreements of the Department of Agriculture (USDA), to define "urban rodent control" (excepted from such activities) as efforts to directly control any mammal in the order Rodentia in a location that is not an airport or in a rural area.

Requires the Comptroller General to submit a report to Congress on activities carried out by the Wildlife Services program of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service that: (1) identifies activities that can be carried out by private sector entities, (2) prioritizes those vital to the protection of public health and safety and agricultural production and that can be performed by such entities, and (3) recommends ways to avoid duplication by the Wildlife Services program and the private sector.</summary>
