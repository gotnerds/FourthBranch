  <summary>8/1/2013--Introduced.
Financial Security Credit Act of 2013 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow an income-based tax credit equal to the lesser of $500 or 50% of the total amount deposited or contributed into designated savings products in a taxable year. Defines "designated savings products" as a qualified retirement plan, a qualified tuition plan, a Coverdell education savings account, a U.S. savings bond, a certificate of deposit with a duration of at least 8 months, a savings account, or other savings product considered appropriate by the Secretary of the Treasury. Directs the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to notify individual taxpayers who may qualify for a savings product tax credit that they have the option of an electronic direct deposit of any portion of their tax refund into a designated savings product.</summary>
