  <summary>4/26/2013--Introduced.
Wounded Veteran Job Security Act - Expands the definition of "service in the uniformed services" for the purposes of uniformed servicemembers' employment and reemployment rights to include a period for which a person is absent from a position of employment to obtain medical treatment for an injury or illness recognized as service connected by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA), or for which a line-of-duty document has been granted by the Secretary of Defense (DOD).

Directs such a person intending to return to a position of employment to notify the employer within a specified time period.

Requires a person submitting an application for reemployment due to such an absence for medical treatment to provide the employer, upon request, with documentation to establish eligibility for reemployment, including a link between the injury or illness and the medical treatment obtained.</summary>
