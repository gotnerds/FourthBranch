  <summary>8/2/2013--Introduced.
Directs the Secretary of the military department concerned to provide to each member of the Armed Forces who is scheduled to be separated from service a copy of such member's medical records in an electronic format.

Requires such records to include any medical records that, in connection with service in the National Guard, are maintained by the governor of the appropriate state, commonwealth, territory, or possession or the Commanding General of the National Guard of the District of Columbia.

Directs the Secretary concerned to provide to a member who is scheduled to be separated a comprehensive physical examination immediately before that separation. Repeals provisions authorizing the waiver of such examination if the member has otherwise undergone an examination within 12 months before the scheduled date of separation. Prohibits a member from being entitled to health care benefits solely by reason of being provided such examination.</summary>
