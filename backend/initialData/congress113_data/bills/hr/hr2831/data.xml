  <summary>7/25/2013--Introduced.
Amends the Internal Revenue Code to deny a tax deduction for any business expenses for marketing directed at children (age 17 or younger) to promote the consumption of food of poor nutritional quality and for related expenses, including for travel, goods or services constituting entertainment, amusement, or recreation, gifts, or other promotion expenses. Defines "food of poor nutritional quality" to mean food and beverages that are determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), to be inconsistent with the most recent government dietary guidelines.</summary>
