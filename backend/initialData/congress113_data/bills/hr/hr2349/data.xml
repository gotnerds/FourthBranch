  <summary>6/13/2013--Introduced.
Get Relief from Academic Debt Act of 2013 or the GRAD Act of 2013 - Amends title IV (Student Assistance) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to allow borrowers of Direct Stafford Loans to opt to extend the period before they must begin to repay such loans to one year after they cease to carry at least one-half the normal full-time academic workload. (Currently, the repayment period for Direct Stafford Loans begins six months after borrowers cease to carry at least one-half the normal full-time academic workload.)

Subsidizes the interest that accrues on Direct Stafford Loans for the first six months of that extended grace period.

Makes this Act applicable to Direct Stafford Loans first disbursed on or after July 1, 2013.</summary>
