  <summary>6/18/2013--Introduced.
Community Parks Revitalization Act - Requires the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to carry out a community revitalization program of federal grants to eligible local governments located within standard metropolitan statistical areas for various park and recreation purposes, including grants for rehabilitation and construction, innovation and recreation programming, and recovery action programs.

Authorizes the Secretary to designate local governments not located in standard metropolitan statistical areas to receive such grants under a partial eligibility waiver.

Prescribes requirements, including matching requirements, for rehabilitation and construction and for innovation and recreation grants.

Limits to 10% the use of funds appropriated for rehabilitation and construction grants for acquisition of land or interests in land.

Allows a recipient, at its discretion, to transfer a grant in whole or in part to private nonprofit agencies for recreational areas and facilities they own or operate which offer recreational opportunities to the general population.

Requires an applicant, for project approval, to submit to the Secretary evidence of its commitment to ongoing planning, rehabilitation, service, operation, and maintenance programs for its park and recreation systems, expressed in a five-year local park and recreation recovery action program.

Prescribes requirements for the five-year park and recreation recovery action program under an at-risk youth recreation grant.

Authorizes the Secretary to increase federal rehabilitation and construction, innovation, and at-risk youth recreation grants to a state under this Act by an additional match of up to 15% (but not more than 15%) of total project or program cost. Limits the aggregate amount of the grant and the additional grant amounts to 85% percent of total project or program cost.

Prohibits the conversion, without HUD approval, of any property improved or developed with assistance under this Act for uses other than for public recreation.</summary>
