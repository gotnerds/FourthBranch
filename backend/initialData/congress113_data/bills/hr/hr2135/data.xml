  <summary>5/23/2013--Introduced.
Cardiac Arrest Survival Act of 2013 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to expand immunity from civil liability related to automated external defibrillator devices (AEDs), including by giving immunity to: (1) a person who owns, occupies, or manages the premises from which an AED is taken or at which an AED is used or attempted to be used on a victim of a perceived medical emergency; and (2) the owner-acquirer of an AED for any harm resulting from the use or attempted use of such device, unless the harm was proximately caused by the failure of the owner-acquirer to properly maintain the device according to the guidelines of the device manufacturer. Applies immunity regardless of whether: (1) the AED is marked with cautionary signage or registered with any government; or (2) the person who used or attempted to use the AED complied with such signage, had received training on such use, or was assisted or supervised by any other person, including a licensed physician.</summary>
