Caring for Military Children with Developmental Disabilities Act of 2014 - Includes in the treatment of military dependents' developmental disabilities under the Department of Defense (DOD) TRICARE program behavioral health treatment, including applied behavior analysis, that is prescribed by a physician or psychologist.

Makes such behavioral health treatment available to retired members of the Coast Guard, the Commissioned Corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the Commissioned Corps of Public Health Service, or their dependents only to the extent that amounts are specifically appropriated to the Defense Health Program Account for their coverage.

Expresses the sense of Congress that amounts should be appropriated for the behavioral health treatment of TRICARE beneficiaries in a manner that ensures that all beneficiaries receive appropriate and equitable access to such treatment.</summary>
