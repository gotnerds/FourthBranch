  <summary>6/5/2013--Introduced.
More Energy More Jobs Act - Instructs the Secretary of the Interior to issue a new oil and gas leasing program under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) for a five-year period in lieu of the existing Five-Year OCS Oil and Gas Leasing Program.

Terminates the existing Five-Year OCS Oil and Gas Leasing Program for 2012-2017.

Prescribes requirements for development of proposed new leasing programs. Requires the Secretary to: (1) allow the governor of a coastal state to nominate for leasing any OCS areas adjacent to state waters, (2) include each nominated area in the draft leasing program, and (3) consider the leasing of such areas as an alternative federal action.

Requires the Secretary to include each state-nominated area in the final program unless the impacts of oil and gas development in a particular area cannot be effectively mitigated and the development is not in the national economic interest.</summary>
