  <summary>3/27/2014--Introduced.
Military Sexual Trauma Claims Administration Reform and Eligibility Act - Establishes a presumption, for the purpose of determining a veteran's eligibility for disability compensation, that a veteran's mental health condition was incurred in or aggravated by military sexual trauma if the veteran so certifies, despite a lack of evidence that such condition or trauma occurred during such service. Makes that presumption rebuttable.

Defines "military sexual trauma" as psychological trauma that, in the judgment of a mental health professional, resulted from a physical assault or battery of a sexual nature or sexual harassment that occurred while the veteran was serving on active duty or active duty for training in the Armed Forces.</summary>
