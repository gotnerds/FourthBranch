  <summary>5/8/2013--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Senate that Congress and states should gather information about and correct: (1) abusive, unsanitary, and illegal abortion practices; and (2) the interstate referral of women and girls to facilities engaged in dangerous or illegal second- and third-trimester procedures.

Declares that Congress has the responsibility to: (1) investigate, and conduct hearings on, abortions performed near, at, or after viability and public policies regarding such abortions; and (2) evaluate the extent to which such abortions involve violations of the natural right to life of infants who are born alive or are capable of being born alive and therefore are entitled to equal protection under the law.

Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) there is a compelling government interest in protecting the lives of unborn children beginning at least from the stage at which substantial medical evidence indicates that they are capable of feeling pain, which is separate from the compelling governmental interest in protecting the lives of unborn children beginning at the stage of viability, and neither governmental interest is intended to replace the other; and (2) governmental review of public policies and outcomes relating to these issues is long overdue and is an urgent priority that must be addressed.</summary>
