  <summary>2/6/2014--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Senate that:

 states and local educational agencies should maintain the right and responsibility of determining educational curricula, programs of instruction, and assessments for elementary and secondary education; the federal government should not incentivize the adoption of common education standards or the creation of a national assessment to align with such standards; and no application process for any federal grant funds or waivers issued by the Secretary of Education under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 should award any additional points, or provide any preference, for the adoption of the Common Core State Standards or any other national common education standards.</summary>
