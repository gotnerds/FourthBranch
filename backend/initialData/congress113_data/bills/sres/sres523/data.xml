  <summary>7/24/2014--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Senate that:

 Prime Minister Narenda Modi of India should address Congress at the earliest opportunity; the U.S. government should hold a strategic dialogue in New Delhi that lays out clear objectives for the U.S.-India relationship; the United States nominate and confirm an Ambassador to India as soon as possible; the United States and India should continue to expand economic engagement, including finalizing a bilateral investment treaty and reviving the Trade Policy Forum; India should continue its economic liberalization reforms, including discussions with other Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum nations about Indian membership in APEC; the United States and India should expand energy, defense, and security cooperation; and India should modify its offset regime so funds can flow to a second tier of Indian priorities such as education, skills development, or manufacturing.</summary>
