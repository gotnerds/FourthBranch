Designates September 22, 2013, as National Falls Prevention Awareness Day.

Recognizes that there are proven, cost-effective falls prevention programs and policies.

Commends the Falls Free Coalition and the falls prevention coalitions in 42 states and the District of Columbia for their efforts to increase education and awareness about the prevention of falls among older adults.

Encourages: (1) raising awareness of falls in an effort to reduce the incidence of falls among older adults, (2) state health departments to reduce falls among older adults, (3) experts in the field of falls prevention to share their best practices.

Urges: (1) the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to continue developing and evaluating interventions to prevent falls among older adults that will translate into effective community-based falls prevention programs; and (2) the Administration for Community Living, CDC, and associated partners to continue to promote evidence-based programs and services in U.S. communities to reduce the number of older adults at risk for falls.</summary>
