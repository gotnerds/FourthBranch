Reiterates the importance of targeted programs for refugee women and girls that prevent and respond to gender-based violence, support self-reliance, and promote leadership skills.

Recognizes the work of the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration of the Department of State, the Office of Refugee Resettlement of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), nongovernmental organizations, advocacy groups, and communities across the United States in resettling refugees in the United States.
