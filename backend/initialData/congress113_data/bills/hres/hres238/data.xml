  <summary>5/23/2013--Introduced.
Supports: (1) U.S. actions that promote peace between Israel and the Palestinians and are designed to ensure the security of Israel and its people, and (2) previous agreements reached between Israel and the Palestinians that recognize Israel's right to exist and promote a Palestinian state.

Commends: (1) the Obama administration and its predecessors for their commitment to Israel's survival and security and for their efforts to promote a resolution of the conflict through Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, and (2) the Obama administration for supporting Israel's Iron Dome Missile Defense System.

Calls on: (1) Hamas to recognize Israel's right to exist, denounce violence, and abide by existing agreements; (2) states, international organizations, and individuals to oppose efforts to deny the Jewish people's historical, cultural, and spiritual connection to Israel; (3) Arab and Muslim-majority states to work towards full normalization of state-to-state relations with Israel; (4) the Israeli government to prevent further settlement expansion in the Occupied Territories; and (5) Israel and Hamas to uphold the existing cease fire agreement.

Applauds President Obama's recent efforts to initiate a new, diplomatic effort to achieve an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement.</summary>
