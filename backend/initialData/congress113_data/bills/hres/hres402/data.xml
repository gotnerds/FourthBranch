  <summary>11/12/2013--Introduced.
Supports the European aspirations of the peoples of the Eastern Partnership countries.

Recognizes the benefits to these and other countries in the Eastern Europe and Caucasus region of closer economic and political ties with the European Union (EU).

Supports the right of all sovereign states to enter into voluntary partnerships.

Rejects the concept of spheres of influence which would divide the European continent.

Calls on Russia to respect the rights of states to make their own sovereign choices with regard to international partnerships, including to sign Association Agreements with the EU.

Applauds the progress Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia have made in adopting democratic norms and standards, and urges Ukraine to address the remaining requirements for signing its Association Agreement with the EU.

Urges the Department of State to continue to work with our European partners and allies to support the right of Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia to enter into voluntary partnerships.</summary>
