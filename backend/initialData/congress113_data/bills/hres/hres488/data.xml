Urges the international community to stand in solidarity with the people of Venezuela and to encourage dialogue between the government and the political opposition.

Urges the Department of State to work with other countries in the Americas to ensure that fundamental freedoms in Venezuela are in accordance with the Inter-American Democratic Charter, and to strengthen the ability of the Organization of American States (OAS) to respond to the erosion of democratic norms and institutions in Venezuela.

Urges the OAS and its Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to seek the most effective way to end the violence in Venezuela in accordance with the Inter-American Democratic Charter.
