  <summary>5/2/2014--Introduced.
Condemns the practice of untouchability and the discriminatory treatment of the Dalits in South Asia and the Asian diaspora.

 Calls on the governments of India, Nepal, the Asian diaspora, and other South Asian nations to: (1) end all forms of untouchability and discrimination of the Dalit people, and (2) ensure respect for internationally recognized human rights for these minority groups.

Demands that the international community put pressure on the governments of nations that still practice Dalit untouchability to end this practice and protect the fundamental rights of all Dalits within their borders.</summary>
