  <summary>2/25/2014--Introduced.
States that it should be the policy of the U.S. government to encourage and facilitate the following efforts concerning Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia:

 entry by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) into negotiations with the World Health Organization to develop a Global Alzheimer's and Dementia Action Plan; involvement of all other nations that have adopted national Alzheimer's and/or dementia plans or strategies; development of the foundation for a Global Alzheimer's Fund that would provide resources to support implementation of specific strategies of the Global Plan and assignment of a high-level person to lead and coordinate initiatives; investigation by the G8 nations of systems to monitor and provide care to persons with Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia in developing countries to help build care delivery capacity; investigation by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) of the foreign aid implications of Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia and inform Congress of the need for possible changes to health care-related foreign assistance; and encouragement and facilitation of partnerships with the private sector, such as the current partnership between the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and 10 pharmaceutical companies to identify new approaches to treat Alzheimer's and other medical conditions.</summary>
