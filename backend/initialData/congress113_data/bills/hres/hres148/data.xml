  <summary>4/10/2013--Introduced.
Expresses support for the goals and ideals of National Youth HIV &amp; AIDS Awareness Day. Encourages state and local governments to recognize and support such a day. Promotes effective and comprehensive HIV prevention education programs as a tool to ensure that all people in the United States are educated about HIV.

Urges youth-friendly and accessible health care services to better provide for the early identification of HIV through voluntary routine testing and to connect those in need to clinically and culturally appropriate care and treatment as early as possible.

Commends the work of AIDS service organizations, community and faith-based organizations, and school-based health centers that are providing youth-friendly, effective, prevention, treatment, care, and support services to young people living with and vulnerable to HIV/AIDS.

Recognizes the importance of interventions that address young people's structural barriers to living healthy lives. Prioritizes youth leadership and development to ensure youth involvement in decisions that impact their health and well-being as well as to advance a pipeline for the next generation of HIV/AIDS professionals as a necessary means to achieving an AIDS-free generation.</summary>
