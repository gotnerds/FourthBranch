Calls on Russia to remove its military forces from Ukraine's Crimean peninsula, other than those operating in accordance with its 1997 agreement on the Status and Conditions of the Black Sea Fleet Stationing on the Territory of Ukraine, and to refrain from interference in all regions of Ukraine, including ending support of separatist and paramilitary forces in Crimea.

Calls on the Administration to work with our European allies and other countries to impose visa, financial, trade, and other sanctions on senior Russian officials and others complicit in Russia's intervention, and on appropriate entities.

States that the United States should participate with its European allies and other countries to provide the Ukrainian government with financial, economic, and technical assistance.
