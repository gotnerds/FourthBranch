Setup Frontend environment
      The frontend environment consists of an ajax and php webpage backed by a MySql database.
      
Install the production database
	Launch mysql and run the source command with backend/production.db as input.

****************************************************
Setup Backend Development environment
      The backend development environment scrapes public congress data to generate the inital database image for the frontend.

Download the initial data

	From congress-github download bills,votes,amendments
	https://github.com/unitedstates/congress#setting-up

	All downloaded data must be copied to backend/initialData/congres#_data folders
	amendments -> backend/initialData/congress#_data/amendments/
	biils -> backend/initialData/congress#_data/bills
	votes -> backend/initialData/congress#_data/votes

	Checkout congress-legislators. Copy legislators-current to backend/inital_data

	Checkout unitedstates/images. Rename congress folder to images, and move images to backend/intial_data

Load internet data into buffer databases
	
	In the fourth branch website there are buffer databases that represent the raw data from outside sources. This data is then santized and checked for inconsitencies before being copied into the production databases.
 
	execute fourthBranch.pl run=install

Sanitize buffer data and load into production
	Sanitize the buffer databases, and output a database image that can be loaded into production.

	execute fourthBranch.pl run=generateProductionDatabase output=production.db
	
	Load the database into production
	
	The production.db file is just a sequence of mysql commands which after running, will generate the database the frontend uses. MySql can load this file directly using the source command, and output is written to loadProduction.log.
